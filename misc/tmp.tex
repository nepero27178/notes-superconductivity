\section{The Abrikosov lattice}

So, in certain conditions magnetic flux can penetrate the sample in a quantized manner, piercing holes with a specific field-current structure -- the Abrikosov vortices. Each of this vortices carries exactly one quantum of flux $\Phi_0$, its ``charge''. Clearly, inverting the direction of the penetrating field, the sign of the charge inverts. Then two classes of vortices exist -- those with charge $+\Phi_0$ and those with charge $-\Phi_0$. The noun ``charge'' is all but casual: as it turns out, \textbf{vortices with same charge repel each other, while vortices with same charge attract each other}. Impressive, isn't it?

This section is devoted to the study of the so-called Abrikosov lattice. The phenomenology is the following: when many vortices with the same charge nucleate in the superconducting sample (maintaining low the vortices density) they create a regular configuration -- a triangular lattice. These vortices, also called \textbf{fluxons}, behave just like particles with a certain interaction law. As low-energy excited states, they are quasiparticles. First, we take off by studying how two fluxons interact.
